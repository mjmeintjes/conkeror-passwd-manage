* Conkeror Password Manager
Extension for [[http://conkeror.org/][Conkeror]] browser that provides facilities to manage passwords using LastPass, and possibly other password managers in the future.

Version: 0.1
* Features
  - Fill passwords
  - Generate and save passwords
* Requirements
** Lastpass CLI
 - Install LastPass CLI from https://github.com/LastPass/lastpass-cli. 
 - If using Multi-factor Authentication, trust the computer you are working on by typing:
    #+begin_src sh
    lpass login --trust <YOUR LASTPASS LOGIN>
    #+end_src
* Installation steps
  - Install Lastpass CLI (see above)
  - Clone this repository into your home directory, or anywhere else (I prefer $HOME/.conkerorrc/modules)
  - Require this module and configure module
    #+begin_src js
    load_paths.push("<YOUR REPOSITORY DIRECTORY>");
    require('conkeror-password-manage');
    passwd_manage_lastpass_username = "YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS";
    #+end_src
  - Restart conkeror
* Usage
** Fill passwords
- Visit the page on which you want to fill passwords
- Press C-t (passwd-get-username-and-password)
- Enter your LastPass master password if prompted
- Answer the questions or accept the defaults
- Username and password should be pasted into login/password fields, can also use C-j (passwd-set-value) to paste username (first press) and then the password (second press) into the focused text box
** Generate passwords
- Visit the page where you want to create an account
- Press C-w x (passwd-generate-and-save)
- Answer the questions or accept the defaults
- New site will be added to LastPass, and generated password can be pasted into focused field by pressing C-j (passwd-set-value)
* Limitations
- On my PC, login prompt is hidden if focus is on a input field - just press ESC to remove focus
- Site selection is currently just based on the "site name" field in LastPass - this makes it difficult if you have more than one account with a site and the names are the same. For me, most of the time I only have one account with a site, and if I have more, I just name them to include my username in the site.
* Todo
- Safety - only paste username and password when actually on the domain specified in LastPass entry
- Add ability to edit usernames and passwords for existing sites
* Licence/Legal
